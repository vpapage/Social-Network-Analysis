# Social Network Analysis

#### This course is an introduction to Network Science and covers the following subjects:  

* Basic network definitions, role of networks and examples in different applications, topology control and network creation.

* Structure and characteristics of complex and social networks: random network models, small-world networks, power-law networks, scale-free networks, regular networks, random geometric networks (random geometric graphs), etc.

*  Analysis elements of complex and social networks: analysis metrics (node ​​degree distribution, aggregation coefficient, network centrality, etc.), selective connection and network creation/evolution.

* Evolutionary computing: genetic algorithms, diagnostic algorithms, parallel computing and computational heuristics.

#### This course offers laboratory projects that emphasize on studying topologies and characteristics of various networks, identifying nodes of network influence, detecting communities with similar characteristics, studying information dissemination/opinion formation, systems and methods of social composition.
